product mission statement
Our MVP is to be the go-to source for everyone looking for quick information about air quality. Our goal is to provide a hassle-free experience for customers by integrating smoothly with the Google Maps API. This will enable them to search for areas, receive precise data on air quality, and comprehend the possible health effects.

During this first stage, we prioritize efficiency and simplicity to make sure consumers can obtain important information without needless complexity. We want to enable people to modify their daily schedules and activities in response to current air quality circumstances by using this user-centric approach.

Our overarching goal is to build an informed and engaged community of people who are motivated to make positive improvements in the air quality because they possess information about it. With the MVP, we're establishing the foundation for a platform that actively involves users in lobbying for and putting into action policies aimed at improving local air quality.

We are dedicated to iteratively improving and growing our product as we deploy this MVP in response to user input and changing environmental requirements. Our goal is to develop with our users, bringing air quality data to the public's attention, enabling it to be used as a tool for constructive change.
